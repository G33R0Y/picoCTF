# PicoCTF Cookies

This is a little program I wrote to solve the PicoCTF Challange "Cookies" from 2021 by Author: madStacks

## What does the program?
It does a request to the given picoCTF URL with a certain Cookie Value and catches the response values and diplays them.

## How to use it?
1. Open the file in some Editor
2. Check if "target_url" is set to the right URL
3. Run python cookiechanger_picoCTF.py
4. Lean back and get the Flag!
